        <h1>Website design – how to start?</h1>
        <div class="main">
          <div class="title">
            What is the purpose of your website – this is where web design
            begins.
          </div>
          <div class="info">
            You need to know what purpose your website is meant to have. That
            way the website you’re designing will be understandable to the
            users.<br /><br />
            If you run a business of some sort, the user needs to know right
            from the start what you have to offer.
            <br /><br />

            For example – you own a car repair garage. The user needs to know
            they have entered a repair garage’s website and that they can use
            specific services.
            <br /><br />

            The purpose of such website is to inform about those services, and
            thus – to gain new clients.
            <br /><br />
            A clearly defined purpose is the key when it comes to designing
            websites. That’s why you need to think about it and clearly define
            the purpose of your website.
            <br /><br />

            Once you know what the purpose of a website is, you need to think
            about who is its audience.
          </div>
          <div class="title">Web design – define your audience.</div>
          <div class="info">
            It’s not like your website is going to be viewed by search engine
            robots only ;). That’s why you need to think about who will be (and
            already is) the audience of your website. <br /><br />
            After all, they’re the ones you want to reach, aren’t they?
            <br /><br />
            Defining the audience of a website is directly related to the
            purpose of your website. They’re the ones to fulfill that purpose,
            after all.
            <br /><br />
            Web design defines such profiling as “persona creation”.
            <br /><br />
            Which means you need to think about what exactly the users are going
            to want from your website and who exactly they are going to be.
            <br /><br />
            You certainly have some profile of your website’s user in your head.
            You need to think about what exactly they need, what their
            preferences are, why they ended up on your website and what they
            should find on it for you to reach your goal.
            <br /><br />
            For example, a perfect user of a car repair garage’s website will be
            someone who needs to have their car repaired.
            <br /><br />
            They want to know what kind of services the garage offers, where it
            is located, what its operating hours are and how to contact it.
            That’s the kind of information they are going to be looking for on
            the website.
            <br /><br />
            Remember – (good) web design is closely related to addressing the
            needs of specific personae. Which means your perfect users. Once you
            define your audience, it will be easier for you to define what the
            user wants to find on your website.

            <br /><br />
          </div>
          <div class="title">Paper and pencil – make web design easier.</div>
          <div class="info">
            It’s always nice to draw something. Especially if you have no idea
            on how to get to designing a website in terms of visuals, just
            remember: it’s always worth it to get inspired, which makes it a
            good idea to go through a few websites that you think are nice and
            draw some conclusions. That’s why it’s better to start designing a
            website with a piece of paper.
            <br /><br />
            Once you have the elements that should be featured on it, you can
            expand it onto subsequent subpages. Make one sheet of paper for each
            individual subpage.
            <br /><br />
            Place subsequent elements on each “subpage” (make sure to maintain
            the order of priority). You don’t have to be afraid to cross things
            out.
          </div>
          <div class="title">
            The most important elements – web design in a nutshell
          </div>
          <div class="info last">
            The most important thing is always the home page. That’s where
            you’re going to place the key information and the elements that
            users should find first.

            <br /><br />Remember that the higher on a page those elements are,
            the faster they’ll be found by users. The home page is at the same
            time the first page a user sees. That’s why it has to be readable
            and feature the key elements. <br /><br />
            It is what helps users navigate around your website. Remember that
            this element should be as understandable as possible.
            <br /><br />
            Which means that typical, cliché subpage names in the menu are what
            your users expect. After all, web design is often based around
            proven solutions.
            <br /><br />
            Main page, offer, price list, contact, customer feedback etc. – such
            structure of the menu will help users find what they are looking for
            faster.
            <br /><br />
            Which means that if you place a segment related to the offer on the
            home page – it’s a good idea to include a link in this segment that
            will redirect users to the subpage with the offer.
            <br /><br />
            When posting articles on the website, remember about maintaining the
            so-called hierarchy of headers. A header may look like big, bold
            text.
            <br /><br />
            In reality, headers serve three main roles on a website: they inform
            about the topic of the text below, they organize the information on
            the page and come in handy in positioning (search engine robots will
            find information in headers faster than in text).
            <br /><br />
            Remember about the hierarchy of headers, too – it allows users to
            know which is general information (related to a group of
            information), and which is detailed information.
            <br /><br />
            The most important thing – a page should only have one H1 header;
            such header should contain the page’s name (which means that on the
            contact page it should be “[your company’s name] – contact” or
            “Contact [your company’s name]”).
            <br /><br />
            It’s also a good idea to add a hyperlink to the home page and a
            short note on your website.
            <br /><br />
            A footer gives a whole lot of opportunities – that’s why you need to
            remember about it when getting into web design.
