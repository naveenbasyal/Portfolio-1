          <h1>The best Web Developer – Questions & Answers</h1>
          <div class="main">
            <div class="title">What is a web developer?</div>
            <div class="info">
              Who is actually a web developer? When interpreting the term
              literally in relation to IT, we could conclude it’s a programmer for
              websites. It is definitely an IT specialist, which means a
              programmer, but there is no way to define it precisely, it’s a very
              general term, and it can only be given a detailed meaning when we
              specify the scope of tasks or technologies. They are responsible for
              web applications — mainly for creating them.<br /><br />
              A web developer has plenty of career paths, sets of skills and
              possibilities. In most cases, it’s a front-end type programmer who
              is responsible for the website visible to the end user, its
              mechanics, the web app. But there are also IT specialists working at
              the so-called back-end as well as DevOps that are referred to as web
              developers. Unlike a web architect, a web developer doesn’t
              specialize in graphics or aesthetics of WWW on the designing side.
              Neither is its content itself within the scope of tasks of a
              front-end developer, the content is taken care of by the client, a
              copywriter or the person in charge of SEO.
            </div>
            <div class="title">
              What are the responsibilities of a web developer?
            </div>
            <div class="info">
              The core of a web developer’s responsibilities is creating the
              source code of a web app. A web dev often watches over the entirety
              of a project, taking the role of a technical consultant, analyst and
              solution architect. <br /><br />
              Who is sought after as a web developer? <br /><br />
              What type of soft and hard skills are required? Before starting your
              first job, you need to master coding in HTML, CSS and JS. These
              three languages are currently the basis of website coding. Due to
              the changing needs of clients, it’s a good idea to learn one of the
              programming languages (like PHP). <br /><br />
              It is very important for a web dev to be immune to stress and be
              able to work under time pressure. In this position, the ability to
              look at the problems at hand in a creative and analytical way is a
              must. Interpersonal skills are also important. Especially if you
              want to be part of a team.
            </div>
            <div class="title">What is responsive design?</div>
            <div class="info">
              Basically it is to develop websites that suit different devices like
              cell phones, tablets and desktop.Thinking about responsive design is
              inherent in building websites. Currently building websites is
              synonymous with performing responsive design.
            </div>
            <div class="title">
              What’s the difference between a web developer and WordPress
              developer?
            </div>
            <div class="info">
              That depends on how you look at it. In case of a limited budget on
              the part of the person ordering a website, which happens pretty
              often on the Polish job market, the role of a person who makes
              WordPress based websites is in most cases limited to installing
              WordPress, implementing a ready-made theme and installing a few
              basic plugins that allow for better content management.
              <br /><br />For more experienced programmers, on the other hand,
              WordPress is merely a “framework” that can be used to create all
              kinds of wonders, which sometimes requires very good knowledge of
              PHP and JS (on top of HTML and CSS, obviously).
            </div>
            <div class="title">
              What are the biggest drawbacks/downsides and upsides of such work?
            </div>
            <div class="info">
              Working in such a position is very demanding, which is why it may
              quickly lead to professional burnout. The biggest downside is
              struggling to meet the deadlines. The frustration, which is often
              related to insufficiently stated requirements, leads to permanent
              stress. The constant changes in the IT industry as well as new
              solutions require constant learning.<br /><br />
              The greatest advantage is the salary and the ability to influence
              millions of users with the software created.
            </div>
            <div class="title">
              What soft and hard skills are needed to become a web developer?
            </div>
            <div class="info">
              The hard skills are a must if you want to work in this position.
              These include, among others, knowledge of different programming
              languages, frameworks, tools required to create, expand and test
              software, as well as knowledge of the English language – at least to
              a degree that allows to freely read and understand technical
              documentation. <br /><br />Employers are also putting a growing
              emphasis on soft skills – as those impact whether a particular
              individual has the ability to work in a group, or predispositions to
              be a link in the company. <br /><br />That’s why a very important
              thing is communication with others, which has a direct impact on the
              atmosphere within the team. The ability to ask the right questions
              and to analyze what in many cases is not very specialized
              information from the client, as well as translate it to a
              programming language, is another appreciated skill that has an
              impact on more than just the work organization.<br /><br />
              This means that the best candidates for this position will be those
              who already possess technical knowledge combined with adequate soft
              skills.
            </div>
            <div class="title">
              What’s the difference between Front-end and Back-end professionals?
            </div>
            <div class="info">
              Front-end developer is responsible for designing the interfaces of a
              website, working with the part of the application that interacts
              with the user. This professional deals with the languages ??on the
              “front” as HTML, CSS and Javascript.
            </div>
            <div class="title">
              What do you find most interesting in the web developer’s job?
            </div>
            <div class="info">
              Working in this position allows you to carry out very diverse types
              of projects, both small websites that will be visited by a small
              number of people as well as large applications that will be used by
              thousands of people from all around the world every day.<br /><br />
              The constant development of web technologies, as well as frequently
              appearing new tools, streamline the work, not allowing for
              stagnation. Programming languages have no nationalities or borders,
              which makes them universal and understandable to developers all over
              the world.
            </div>
            <div class="title">
              What’s the difference between a web designer and web developer?
            </div>
            <div class="info">
              The web designer works with website design, but caring about issues
              that aim for ease of use that user experiences. Whereas on the other
              hand, a web developer deals with the code part of the interfaces.
            </div>
            <div class="title">
              What are the greatest difficulties/downsides and upsides of this
              job?
            </div>
            <div class="info">
              What makes this job interesting is at the same time its greatest
              advantage. What might be an upside to some will be a downside to
              others, which is why everyone who is forward-thinking about
              programming should find out for themselves and develop their opinion
              on the topic. It’s the kind of job that should arise from passion –
              if it’s not something we enjoy then, just like any other, it won’t
              give us the sense of accomplishment, satisfaction and fulfillment.

            <div class="title">
              What is the difference between website and webpage?
            </div>
            <div class="info last" >
              The difference between a website and a web page is that a website
              consists of a number of web pages, whilst a web page is, as its name
              suggests, just one page. In essence, a web page is akin to the page
              of a book, it being a small part of a website, just as a page is of
              a book.
