        <h1>How much does a WordPress website cost?</h1>
        <div class="main">
          <div class="title">Defining the purpose of the WordPress website</div>
          <div class="info">
            First, check what you really care about. The first step to create an
            attractive, functional and tailored to your needs WordPress website
            is to precisely define what page you need: <br /><br />

            1.Is it supposed to be only a business card containing basic data
            about the company, its services, products?
            <br /><br />
            2.Is the website created in accordance with the latest graphic
            trends, with interesting functionalities and especially
            Google-friendly?
            <br /><br />

            <h2>For whom the WordPress website is to be created?</h2>
            <br /><br />
            For whom the website is to be created and for what purpose – these
            are the main questions when it comes to determining the price of a
            website on WordPress. If this website is to be intended for a small
            company, one-man, it will not be extensive and will have only basic
            subpages such as: About us, Offer, Contact. However, if the website
            is intended for a large company, we are talking about a website with
            an extensive structure, graphic design and numerous functionalities.
            So comparing these two cases, we can immediately see that on the
            other side, the design team has to spend much more time than for a
            small business card side, which at the same time affects the final
            price.
            <br /><br />
            <h2>What are the WordPress website graphics requirements?</h2>
            <br /><br />
            Another issue is the graphics of the site set up on WordPress. The
            original graphic design distinguishes the website, but also
            significantly affects the price.
          </div>
          <div class="title">Choosing a WordPress site contractor</div>
          <div class="info">
            Who to entrust the implementation of your WordPress website? This
            stage is extremely important because you may come across unreliable
            contractors on the Internet. Remember a website that is made
            quickly, cheaply and “professionally” simply does not exist and will
            probably generate additional costs in the future. Professionalism
            requires both time and resources. Therefore, we do not recommend
            commissioning the creation of a website to people who advertise
            themselves on the Internet and in Facebook groups.

            <br /><br />
            First of all, you should look for a contractor who has a diverse and
            interesting portfolio, which will confirm his professionalism in
            website design. You should also take a look at the contractor’s
            website, because it is a showcase of his skills. Check what
            approximate costs you have to face by comparing the price lists on
            the website or by sending an inquiry. The very low price may be
            because the contractor is an amateur and your future WordPress site
            will not live up to your expectations and will even require
            additional costly changes and tweaks. Remember that the website will
            be your business card on the Internet and customers will identify
            you with it before buying or choosing your services. That is why it
            is worth entrusting work on it to a professional

            <br /><br />
          </div>
          <div class="title">Time to complete the WordPress website</div>

          <div class="info">
            After choosing the creator of your website, it’s time to estimate
            the time needed to create the website. It usually takes about 5-40
            days to create a WordPress website. If you have tight deadlines for
            your website and you need your website to be completed faster, it is
            obviously not impossible, but it will be reflected in the higher
            price.

            <br /><br />
            Creating a website is a process that consists of several stages.
            Starting from talks and negotiations, through drawing up a contract
            with a detailed specification, analysis, looking for inspiration,
            creating a functional and graphic concept, implementation and
            testing. Each of these stages lasts, costs and often requires the
            involvement of many people – project manager, graphic designers, UX
            utility, programmer. The exact time needed to create a website
            depends, of course, on the level of complexity, graphic design and
            functionality:

            <br /><br />
            1. The business card website is a time from 5-15 days of work of a
            graphic designer and programmer

            <br /><br />

            2.The basic website is about 10 days to a month of work for a
            graphic designer and programmer

            <br /><br />

            3. The extended (premium) website is a month and more of work for a
            graphic designer and programmer
