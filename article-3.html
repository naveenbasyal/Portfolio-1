        <h1>Looking for a WordPress expert?</h1>
        <div class="main">
          <div class="title">A WordPress expert is always in style</div>
          <div class="info">
            Yeahâ€¦ A WordPress expert is a concept as trendy and popular in the
            industry. You can find a lot of people online who claim to be
            WordPress experts, but, as things online tend to be, itâ€™s often
            difficult to verify the truth behind those words. Letâ€™s start by
            defining right away who a WordPress expert is and isnâ€™t [or who a
            WordPress expert should and shouldnâ€™t be].
          </div>
          <div class="title">Who is a WordPress expert?</div>
          <div class="info">
            Would you call someone a expert if they optimize a website by
            installing the WP Rocket plugin and run an audit by typing the
            GTmetrix tool in the URL address? Of course not. A WordPress expert
            is someone who REALLY knows the topic of WordPress. It is someone
            who has cut their teeth and pulled a lot of hair out of their scalp
            by solving problems and learning WordPress back when it wasnâ€™t yet
            featured in the name of every other agency on the Polish market.

            <br /><br />
            A WordPress expert is someone who has experience, a rich portfolio
            and broad knowledge on the WordPress system. Itâ€™s an individual [or
            a company â€“ thatâ€™s where WordPress experts work, after all] who,
            when you approach them with a problem, will give you a complete
            solution and guide you by the hand towards the goal.

            <br /><br />
            Although we do know itâ€™s a myth, we can still go ahead and say that
            no one will become a expert after 100 hours of working with
            WordPress, let alone an expert [thatâ€™s right â€“ before you criticize
            me, I can attest that I have spent more than 10 thousand hours with
            WordPress].

            <br /><br />
            A WordPress expert is also someone who knows their worth. Donâ€™t
            expect the best experts on the market to do work for you for 7-8
            dollars/hour. The rates for those people start at net 20 dollars for
            every new work hour. The best experts canâ€™t complain about not
            getting orders and donâ€™t waste their time, quite the opposite â€“ they
            often pick their own projects that they want to carry out. Of
            course, high prices are not an indicator of whether youâ€™re just
            talking with a WordPress expert, but is it worth it to risk the
            success of your plans by assuming that the cheaper the better? I
            donâ€™t think so.

            <br /><br />
            A WordPress expert is a programmer, an analyst, a copywriter, a
            marketer, a salesperson and every other person who devotes most of
            their time to this exact platform. It is someone for whom WordPress
            is a source of constant development, of growing experience, or even
            of smile on their face ðŸ™ƒ Could you be good at a job that you donâ€™t
            like? Exactly, let alone a expert, or even an expert. A real
            WordPress expert is capable of implementing every functionality and
            solution for you, but watch out! They will always do this the most
            optimal way, using their own knowledge and experience in WordPress.

            <br /><br />
          </div>
          <div class="title">How to spot a WordPress expert</div>
          <div class="info last">
            There are several ways to verify whether someone is a WordPress
            expert or not.

            <br /><br />
            Hereâ€™s a list of things you need to check in order to make sure that
            youâ€™re hiring a real WP expert/expert!

            <br /><br />
            1. Ask the expert or the company about the portfolio â€“ check out
            what projects they have to show for themselves and whether they suit
            your requirements and aesthetic taste.
            <br /><br />

            2. Verify the credibility of the WordPress expert on Social Media
            [LinkedIn, Facebook], on Google [search engine, maps], in the
            business register, in the court register and on the website,
            analyzing their history and reviews.
            <br /><br />

            3. Listen to what they say or write, whether it is substantial talk
            and an offer, or if itâ€™s just a lot of padding and trying to hide
            their ignorance. Ask them a difficult question on WordPress that
            wouldnâ€™t be easy to find an answer to online.
            <br /><br />
            4. Find out how they work and what will be their operating process
            for your problem. A WordPress expert will always have a ready
            strategy and a well thought-out workflow.
            <br /><br />
            5. Pay attention to the contact, the response time, the e-mail
            address they use to communicate and whether you donâ€™t feel too
            pressured to close the sale â€“ remember that a good expert never
            complains about lack of work!
            <br /><br />
            6. Compare several offers and the prices per man-hour. Pick the one
            that respects their time, as you will have the highest chances of
            them respecting yours as well!
            <br /><br />
            7. If youâ€™re planning to hire a WordPress company [or agency ðŸ™„] ask
            for the contact info of the person who is going to serve you and
            check if they show enthusiasm and willingness to act!
            <br /><br />
            8. In case of a company, ask for a NDA agreement [a confidentiality
            agreement] and an e-mail confirmation of the arrangements, and in
            case of a private individual for an ID scan and a scope of work
            agreement â€“ a reliable counterparty will never have any problem with
            that.
            <br /><br />
            9. Last but not least, before you sign the agreement, if you still
            have any doubts, make a phone call and have a talk or arrange a
            conference online to get to know the person you are going to entrust
            with your brand and budget.
